CSCI 4565/5565 HW1

The assignment was to create a simple glut program that opens a window and draws points and lines as a user creates them using the mouse. When the user clicks the left mouse button a new point will be added to the series of points and connected by a line. 
Additionally, the user can "drag" by holding down the left mouse button and the subsequent line that will be drawn can be previewed in real time. 
Finally, when the user click the right mouse button the shape that has been drawn by the lines will be filled in with color. 

My program compiles, runs and meets all specifications. Buit on Windows 10, Visual Studio Community 2017. In my bar for running I have "Debug -- x64 -- Local Window Debugger" selected. 
NOTE: I could not get the hw1_windows.exe example file to work on my machine. However, I could still develop with GLUT. I'm concerned this might mean YOU won't be able to run my program? Let me know via email or canvas if this is an issue.
